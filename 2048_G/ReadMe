Enjoy the Game!: Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move the tiles on the board. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one! Keep merging tiles to reach the 2048 tile and win the game.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to move the tiles on the board in the desired direction.
When you press an arrow key, all the tiles on the board will slide in that direction as far as possible.
If two tiles with the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the sum of their values.
After every move, a new tile will randomly appear on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
Continue merging tiles and strategically planning your moves to reach the elusive 2048 tile!
