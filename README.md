### Description
  This is a Python implementation of the popular 2048 game using the Pygame library.

## How to Run

    Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: python.org.

3. #### Install Pygame:
    This game relies on the Pygame library. You can install Pygame using pip, the Python package installer.

```

python main.py
```
6. #### Enjoy the Game!:
    Use the arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move the tiles on the board. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one! Keep merging tiles to reach the 2048 tile     and win the game.

## How to Play
  * Use the arrow keys to move the tiles on the board in the desired direction.
  * When you press an arrow key, all the tiles on the board will slide in that direction as far as possible.
  * If two tiles with the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the sum of their values.
  * After every move, a new tile will randomly appear on the board with a value of either 2 or 4.
  * Continue merging tiles and strategically planning your moves to reach the elusive 2048 tile!
